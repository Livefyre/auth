# Auth

Web Components frequently need to know about and/or trigger authentication by
the end-user, but should not need to be tightly-coupled to any one authentication
strategy.

## For Site Operators

Web Site operators make the decisions about what sort of authentication strategies
they prefer. They should be able to delegate the details to an Auth object to
coordinate the effort.

This module exports a function that will create an Auth object. Usually there
will only be one Auth object running on a webpage.

On load, a customer should
use the `.delegate` method to configure this Auth object by passing an
'authentication delegate' like the following:

    auth.delegate({
        // Called when a component would like to authenticate the end-user
        // You may want to redirect to a login page, or open a popup
        // Call `finishLogin` when login is complete, passing an Error object
        // if there was an error, and authentication credentials if they have
        // been procured
        login: function (finishLogin) {
            finishLogin();
        },

        // Called when a component would like to deauthenticate the end-user
        // You may want to clear a cookie
        // Call `finishLogout` when logout is complete, passing an Error object
        // if there was an error
        logout: function (finishLogout) {
            finishLogout();
        }
    });

## For Component Developers

A Web Component developer may wish to be notified when end-user authentication
status changes. For example, certain actions may only be enabled if the user
is authenticated. Or if the user is not authenticated, the component may wish
to render a 'Log in' link.

For these purposes, component developers can listen for events emitted by an
Auth object

    auth.on('login', setUserLoggedIn.bind(this, true));
    auth.on('logout', setUserLoggedIn.bind(this, false))
